# Greetings!
Hey everyone!

So, funny story – I recently had a bit of a mishap and found myself with a lot of free time. What better way to spend it than diving into the world of coding, right? I decided to teach myself Python and ended up writing some code to calculate the damage from my little adventure. It’s been a wild ride – tricky at times, but definitely a blast!


I know, it's just a trivial .py. I just wanted to look cool. lol
